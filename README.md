# Assignment 1

## Overview

This repository serves as a template for **Group Assignment 1** in the course **46750 - Optimization in Modern Power Systems**. It provides a structured starting point for your project, including:

- Example datasets for all assignment questions
- Starter Python code to help you begin your analysis
- Licensing information
- Dependency files (`requirements.txt` and `environment.yaml`)
- A `.gitignore` file
- This `README.md` with setup and usage instructions

**Note:** This structure is not definitive, and can be adapted to meet each groups' needs as the project advances.

## Installation

Follow the installation instructions below to start working on your group assignment.

### 1. **Clone the repository**

To begin, create a copy of this repository for your group. 

### 2. **Create a virtual environment**

Follow these steps to set up a clean Python environment and install the required packages, so that all required packages are installed when running your code, and your project packages won’t affect the system or other projects.

#### **Option A: Using pip**

To create an isolated Python environment in a folder called venv (its own Python interpreter + its own site-packages and pip):
```bash
python -m venv venv 
```
Then activate that environment (on macOS/Linux):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate 
```
Or, using Windows cmd: `\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` or Windows PowerShell: `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`. Your shell’s PATH is changed so python/pip now point to the ones inside venv.

Install all packages listed in requirements.txt into the active virtual environment (modify the requirements file as needed).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Option B: Using conda**

Create and activate a virtual environment, using the file environment.yaml (modify the environment file as needed):
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate gurobi-opt
``` 

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** as described above.
2. **Explore the starter code** in `main.py` and the `src/` folder to understand the workflow.
3. **Add your code**:
    - Implement new functions or classes in the appropriate `src/` subfolder.
    - Update `main.py` to call your new code for data processing, model setup, or result analysis.
4. **Run simulations** by executing:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    or, if using a Jupyter notebook, run the provided cells.

5. **Visualize results**: Output files, plots, or logs will be generated as specified in your code. Adjust the code to save results in your preferred format.

**Note:** As you extend the codebase, document any new scripts or modules, and changes in structure, in this README for clarity and reproducibility.

### Starter Code Structure

 The starter code is organized as follows:

- `main.py`: Entry point for running simulations and analyses. This script parses arguments, loads data, initializes models, and coordinates the workflow.
- `src/`: Contains all source code modules.
    - `src/data_ops/`: Classes and functions for loading, validating, and preprocessing input datasets (e.g., reading JSON files, checking data integrity, and preparing data structures for modeling).
    - `src/opt_model/`: Modular optimization models and algorithms for each assignment question. Each submodule can represent a different modeling approach or scenario, making it easy to extend or modify optimization logic.
    - `src/runner/`: Scripts or classes that orchestrate the end-to-end execution of simulations, including setting up experiments, running optimization routines, and collecting results.
    - `src/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers, such as plotting routines, configuration file parsers, logging setup, and other reusable code snippets.

## Input Data Structure

**Note:**  
These files allow customization of user behavior, DER production, and network constraints for simulation and optimization. Students can extend or replace these datasets as needed to conduct adequate simulations and sensitivity analysis. We recommend that any new or modified files follow the same structure for compatibility with the starter code, and easy grading. Please document all new datasets in this README.md file.
